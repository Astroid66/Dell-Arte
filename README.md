# Dell-Arte
Institute Technical Summer Project, IIT Bombay. Technology-driven initiative to create graffiti art on a wall.

Conceptualized an autonomousWall Printing Bot in SolidWorks that can print a binary image on a wall efficiently
Deployed Blender Python API, to code the simulation of the working of the Robot and showing its Painting action in Blender
Simulated the mechanism and structure of the bot such as using CV universal joints for more flexible movements,
Selective Printing using solenoid mechanisms, Precision control of the printing head using 2 axis rail mechanism
Implemented folding rail mechanism to lower the centre of mass of the bot to ease movement during Painting
